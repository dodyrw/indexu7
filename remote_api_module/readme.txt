What doest the api do:
- Add listing (see client test script for detail)

The api_key in client script must be the same with the one in api.php file.

Installation:
1) Copy /api folder in indexu main folder
2) Change api_key in api.php, use your own secret phrase.
3) Use client script as starting point to develop client script
4) To secure the installation, remove /api/client folder.
